# Cyber Security Resources

A curated list of cyber security resources that I find useful and/or entertaining. Includes: websites, podcasts, Twitter accounts, and much more! This list will be updated (hopefully) often. Feel free to contribute to it, or let me know if you think something is incorrect!

## Websites:
Websites to check out occasionally for news or tutorials. I personally have The Hacker News as my homepage, so I can stay up to date on info-sec news.

| Links | Descriptions |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/) | All purpose cyber security news source. Does a good job of presenting information at a higher level, but often links to more in-depth sources. |
| [HAK5](https://www.hak5.org/) | The makers of HAK5 pentesting gear (usb ducky, wifi pineapple, etc.). Has a **TON** of great resources including news, demos, and of course gear in their shop. |

## Podcasts:
I love to listen to podcasts on long drives, while working on more repetitive tasks, and for general background noise. Here are some great security focused podcasts!

| Links | Descriptions |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [Defensive Security Podcast](http://defensivesecurity.org/) | Recent security news from a defensive perspective. |
| [Hacked Podcast](http://www.hackedpodcast.com/) | "A podcast about the curious, enlightening and occasionally criminal underbelly of the internet." Presents cyber security information (typically from an offensive perspective) at a higher level than other podcasts on this list. |
| [Vince in the Bay Podcast](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vince-in-the-bay-podcast) | Not strictly a cyber security podcast, more of a general technology and "internet culture" podcast, but often tends to cover info-sec subjects in episodes. |
| [Brakeing Down Security Podcast](http://brakeingsecurity.com/) | *One of my favorites*, covers topics in security, privacy, and much more! Tends to offer a more in-depth view of topics, but still accessible to less experienced audiences. |
| [Risky Business Podcast](https://risky.biz/netcasts/risky-business/) | A weekly podcast featuring news and interviews with people in the industry. A self proclaimed "must-listen digest for information security pros". |
| [Open Source Security Podcast](http://www.opensourcesecuritypodcast.com/) | "A podcast about security with an open source slant." |

## Twitter Accounts:
As someone who stalks Twitter often one of the ways I have found most effective for staying up to date on whats happening in the world of security is by following as many info-sec accounts on Twitter as possible. There is a large community of info-sec enthusiasts and professionals on Twitter, but here are some of my favoites. I guess I should note that many of these accounts don't strictly tweet about cyber security, as many of them are personal accounts. If you don't like them or the oppinions they have ~you don't have to follow them~.

## YouTube Channels:
| Links | Descriptions |
| ----- |:------------:|
| [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w) | *One of my personal favorites*. Tutorials on many different subjects. Videos tend to be accessible to people of all skill levels, and fun to watch! |
| [JackkTutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC64x_rKHxY113KMWmprLBPA) | Videos that cover many subjects in computing, but tends to focus on security. Great tutorials here for anyone interested in fun security projects. |
| [GynvaelEN](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCkVMojdBWS-JtH7TliWkVg) | Wasn't sure whether to put this under Toutube or Podcasts, but this channel posts great podcasts covering CTFs they have participated in. Very talented hacker, and a great way to learn a thing or two. |
| [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) | "Videos all about computers and computer stuff. Sister channel of Numberphile." Videos tend to focus on computer science as a whole, but there is lots of good security stuff here! |
| [DEFCONConference](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6Om9kAkl32dWlDSNlDS9Iw) | The official DEFCON youtube channel, posts talks recorded from the yearly DEFCON conference held in Vagas. Talks cover a wide variety of topics and there is something here for everyone! It's far to easy for me to fall down a YouTube hole on this channel and end up binging hours of DEFCON talks. |
| [Crazy Danish Hacker](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClg0eyJTbAZaYuz3mhwfBBQ) | Another hacking tutorial channel. They do a great job of covering things at a low level, but makes it very easy to understand. I have also found that a lot of their videos cover topics that are sometimes harder to find comprehensive tutorials on.|

## Journals:
| Links | Descriptions |
| ----- |:------------:|
| [PoC\|\|GTFO](https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/) | A famous journal published for free and distributed at hacker conferences containing white papers that cover offensive security research, reverse engineering, and file format internals. Linked is a mirror of PDFs of the published issues, tread lightly the website looks a little sketchy. |

## War Games
| Links | Descriptions |
| ----- |:------------:|
| [Over The Wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/) | A plethora of war games that can teach you various security skills. There is something here for people of all skill levels, it was actually what I used to take my first steps in the world of information security. |
